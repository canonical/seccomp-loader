Code Inspection

Code Clarity: The overall structure of the code is relatively clear. Function names are descriptive, which is beneficial for readability.

Function Separation: The code is modular, with separate functions for different tasks (reading the header, reading the filter, applying the filter). This is good practice.

Documentation: Consider adding comments for complex logic or non-obvious sections to improve maintainability and clarity for future developers.

Suggested Improvements

1. Error Codes Instead of Exit: Modify die to return error codes. This will allow the calling function to decide how to handle errors.


2. Explicit Validation: Add checks for the contents of hdr after reading it to ensure they conform to expected values.


3. Memory Freeing: Always free allocated memory after its use, ideally in a cleanup function or a structured error handling path.


4. Enhance Unit Tests: Implement tests for all edge cases, including error scenarios. This will improve the robustness of your code.



By implementing these suggestions, the code can become more robust, maintainable, and easier to use.
